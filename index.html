  <h3>A Design Thesis</h3>

<section class="introduction" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<img class="typewriter" src="img/typewriter.jpg" alt="typewriter">

<p>
When people think of typewriters they might think of the times when there were no such thing as computers. Back then people used typewriters as a writing tool to type up documents such as school papers, letters, and business documents. What many people don’t realize is that typewriters can be used as a creative tool to draw and make patterns.
</p>
<p>
Intertwined is a thesis that explores this tool in a creative way instead of as a tool for formal communication. You will notice that I have overlapped or intertwined letters to create different tonal values of color and make abstract shapes. Throughout the pages of this book is the process for my senior graphic design thesis project at Montserrat College of Art.

<h2>Fall 2016 Work</h2>

<p>
The work that I produced in the Fall of 2016 in design seminar is what brought me to where I am today with this project. During that semester I became interested in using typewriters. That is when I began to work on my typewriter drawing experiments on notepad paper. I eventually worked on a peice of antique paper to further my experimentation and pattern making.

<h2>Typewriter Drawings Book</h2>

<p>
I created a book from all of the drawings that I produced during the fall of 2016 and spring 2017.This book contains all of the pages that I scanned in to the computer. It was a long process because not only did I design the book but I also had to clean up most of the images in Photoshop. The reason I had to do that was so that they would sit nicely on the pages of the book without seeing the scanner background with them.
</p>

<p>
I ended up revising the book because I wasn’t happy with the way that it came out after it was printed. I realized that there were things that needed to be changed and added to make it better.

<h2>Works On Antique Paper</h2>

<p>
Since I really enjoy old things I decided to order old paper for this project. The paper that I ordered was typewritten in 1912 and 1913. I completely typed over the entire document and covered the original text so it can’t be easily read anymore. I used different color typewriter ink ribbons to give a different effect on the page than just black ink. Looking at the closeup images of these pages you can see the patterns that are made with the overlapped letters.
</p>

<p>
Last semester I enjoyed typing on John Mcvey’s ledger paper from the 1900’s so that’s the reason I wanted to do more of that as well. In all of these pages you can almost see a weaving effect going on making them very intriguing to look at.

<h2>DOTS Iconset</h2>

<p>
I designed an ornamental circle icon set by vectorizing the overlapped letters from the notepad typewriter drawings. This icon set consists of every lowercase letter of the alphabet. I wanted people to be able to download a unique iconset for their projects and be able to change the color. They can be used for many different things such as borders in a document, bullet points, dividers between sections in a chapter of a book, and even a textural brush in Photoshop or Illustrator. I also made stickers out of these icons which alot of people seemed to like so I might start selling them.

<h2>Other Experiments</h2>

<p>
  I wanted to do a little bit more  experimenting and have fun with the patterns that I made instead of just keeping them in a circle. I thought of the idea of putting them inside of the American Typewriter typeface. Although I wasn’t happy with the outcome it allowed me to see what else I can do with these patterns.
</p>

<p>
I also designed a few different organic shapes. These were made by extracting sections of the overlapped letters.

<h2>Exhibition</h2>

<p>
On the week of March 29th, 2017 my work was on display at Montserrat College of Art’s 301 Gallery. The exhibition which was called Schema, featured nine other senior designers thesis work. The opening reception was a sucess and I got a lot of compliments on my display. People enjoyed typing their comments about my work on the typewriter that I let people use.
